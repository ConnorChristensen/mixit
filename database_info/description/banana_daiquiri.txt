Frequently served on arrival at cocktail parties, this icy cold mixture is always warmly revived by guests. Simple to prepare in large quantities, different combinations of fruits can be added to the base mix without deliberation. Adjust measurements of lemon and sugar accordingly for a sweeter or sour taste. Where unripe fruit is used, fruit liqueurs will enrich the flavor.
